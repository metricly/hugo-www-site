### About

[Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) is a cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service that translates names like `www.example.com` into numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1; it is also fully compliant with IPv6. Metricly now supports some out-of-the-box default policies and metrics for Route 53.

What you'll need to get started:

-   [AWS Integration](https://docs.metricly.com/integrations/aws-integration/)

### Packaged Policies

-   **Connection Time: **The connection time is higher than usual. *ConnectionTime* is the average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers to establish a TCP connection with the endpoint.
-   **Health Check Status**: The Health Check failed. *HealthCheckStatus* is the status of the health check endpoint that CloudWatch is checking. 1 indicates healthy, and 0 indicates unhealthy.
-   **Time of First Byte**: The time to first byte is higher than usual. *TimeToFirstByte* is the average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers to receive the first byte of the response to an HTTP or HTTPS request.
